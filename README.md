# sudoku_web
This is a website sudoku solver I made that can solve a sudoku puzzle based on an image of the puzzle, or by manually entering the puzzle. To see a demo, go to https://youtu.be/lgouKNkifJI

I used Flask for the framework and used a backtrack search algorithm and certain inferences to find a solution to the puzzle in python. I used Tensorflow to train two Object Detection models and one classification model for the image processing of the puzzle, and Tensorflow.js to deploy the models client-side.
